/*
There are three essential data types to know for now, and here is your first test of memorization (don't worry, we will practice):

String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".
Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
Boolean: This is always one of two words. Either true or false, with no quotations.

var myString = "myName";
var myNumber = 7;
var myBoolean = true;


// Do not edit the code under this line
console.log("Name: " + myString);
console.log("Lucky Number: " + myNumber);
console.log("Good joke? " + myBoolean);
