/*
We can't do much programming with our knowledge of types right now, so let's build something cool. Let's learn how to ask JavaScript to talk to us.

To do this, we need two things:

A way to ask JavaScript to talk.
Something for JavaScript to say.
We can ask JavaScript to print words to the console with this line of code:

console.log('Your message here.');
In human-speak, this is saying: "Hey console, please print/log this thing inside the parentheses. Bye, thanks!"

By writing this line, we've also solved the second thing we need: Something for JavaScript to say. We can put a String, Number, or Boolean (or any data type) inside the parentheses of a console.log statement.
*/

console.log('hello console')
